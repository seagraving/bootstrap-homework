# Homework 02- Bootstrap Portfolio

This repository was created to hold the newest information concerning an incredibly new "web-developer" type of person named Sarah Seagraves. She will hopefully prove her knowledge of how to use Bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio.

Contents will include:
* Main bio/About me section
* Portfolio (a bit empty at the moment)
* Contact page (so you can bother her about her portfolio!)

She will be making commits more frequently to create a better history of her projects.

Hope this works out!
